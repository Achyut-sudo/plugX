DESIGN CHOICE : TO IMPLEMENT RIGHT MARGIN FOR THE CONTENT

	CURRENTLY, INDENT ATTRIBUTE IMPLEMENTS THE LEFT MARGIN FOR THE CONTENT IN A CONTAINER TAG , WHICH IS EASY TO IMPLEMENT AS THE COLUM
        NUMBER OF ANY LINE STARTS FROM 0 FROM THE LEFT SO INDENT ATTROBUTE  HAS FIXED ANCHOR TODEFINE THE MIN COLUMN FOR ANY LINE ,
	BUT IN CASE OF RIGHT INDENT/MARGIN ,  DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FIXED ANCHOR FOR IT TO DEFINE THE COLUMN AS THE COLUMN IN THE RIGHT IS NOT
        FIXED

	SO THERE , ARE TWO CHOICES 


	1. DO NOT ADD SUPPORT FOR RIGHT INDENT/MARGIN 


	2. DEFINE A ATTRIBUTE NAMED MAX LINE COLUMN TO DEFFINE THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF  ANY LINE 
		
		IN THIS WAY THE RIGHT INDENT/MARGIN CAN DEFINE THE  MAX COLUMN VALUE BASED ON THE  DEFINED VALUE 

		THIS ATTRIBUTE CAN BE  CONTANT IF DEFINED IN THE FILE , IF NOT THEN CALCULATED DYNAMICALLY 

		1. IN GLOBAL CONTAINER TAG , IF DEFINED THEN THAT VALUE IS DEFINED  THE WHOLE DOCUMENT , IF NOT THEN A METHOD IS DEFINED IN
	           THE PARSER  WHICH WILL DEFINE THE VALUE FOR THIS ATTRIBUTE BASE ON THE SYSTEM SCRREN SIZE ETC .  
		2. IF DEFINED IN CONTAINER TAG OTHER GLOBAL TAG, THEN OVERWRITES THE VALUE OF THE ATTRIBUTE FORO THE CURRENT TAG AND ITS 
		   CHILDS , BUT IF NOT DEFINED THE GLOBAL VALUE IS USED 


		VALID FOR GLOBAL , SECTION , TABLE AND CELL CONTAINER TAGS , IGNORED IN CASE OF ROW CONTAINER TAG 



	WHAT SHOULD BE THE NAMES OF THE  LEFT AND RIGHT ATTRIBUTES ?
	
		1. LEFT_INDENT/ RIGHT_INDENT
		2. MARGIN_LEFT/MARGIN_RIGHT 
		3. LEFT_MARGIN/RIGHT_MARGIN 
		3. INDENT/RIGHT_MARGIN 
		4. INDENT/RIGHT_INDENT  

SELECTED APPROACH : 2 and Name : 1. LEFT_MARGIN/RIGHT_MARGIN 

2. ATTRIBUTTE FOR RIGHT MARGIN ANCHORING :



	1. MAX_LINE_SIZE 
		THE MAX_COLUMN BECOMES  RELATIVE AS THE MAX_COLUMN FOR EACH LINE  NEEDS CALCULATION , BASED ON MAX_SIZE AND LEFT_MARGIN ,
		NUT IS MORE COMPRHENSIBLE IN TERM OF USAGE IN THE DOCUMENT.    


	2. MAX_LINE_COLUMN
		THE MAX_COLUMN IS EASIER IN TERMS OF IMPLEMNTATIONS , BUT IS DIFFICULT IN  TERMS OF USER UNDERSTANDING AS THE MAX_COLUMN
		MIGHT NOT BE APPARENT  AS MUCH AS MAX_SIZE IS 


SELECTED APPRAOCH : 2 

3. CONDITONAL RENDERING AND EVALUATION 

	1. DEFINE A ATTRIBUTE 'MODE' WHICH CONTROLS THE RENDERING OF THE VALUE 

		NOW THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS 
		
		1. MODE ATTRIBUTE IS A   BINARY  VALUE KEY 
			1. RENDER : RENDERS THE TAG 
			2. SKIP : SKIPS RENDERING THE TAG 

		2. RENDER ATTRIBUTE IS A MUTLTIPLE VALUE KEY 
			1. EVALUATE_ONLY : ONLY EVALUATE BUT DONT RENDER 
			2. EVALUATE_IF_REQUIRED : EVAULUATE IF REQUIRED EITHER  IN THE CURRENT DOCUMENT OR IN THE DOCUMENT WHERE ITS IS 
						  IMPORTED  
			3. RENDER  : EVAULATE AND THE RENDER 
			4. SKIP : NO EVALUATION NO RENDERING  

	2. NO SUCH ATTRIBUTE : I.E EVEERYTHING IS EVALUATED AND RENDERED 
		
SELECTED APPROACH : 1.2 


4. CONDITIONAL ERROR HANDLING/ERROR FALLBACK 

	
	IN ANY TAG THE SOURCES OF ERROR CAN BE 
		+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
		| TAG ATTRIBUTE     | EITHER IGNORE/WARN AND USE DEFAULT VALUE, PROPAGATE ERROR OR HANDLE THOURGH FALLBACK |
		+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
		| CONTENT OF THE TAG| SINCE THIS IS THE MINA CONTENT OF THE RENDERED TAG , THEN MUST BE HANDLED THORUGH THE|
		|                   | FALLBACK MECHANISM                                                                   |
		+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	+----------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	|          | CONTENT          | SINCE THE ONLY SOURCE OF THE ERROR IN CONTENT IS THE PLUGS , THEN ERROR CAN BE HANDLE  THROUGH     |
	|          | CHILD TAG        | THE ERRORS IN CHILD TAG MUST BE HANDLED LOCALLY , SHOULD NOT BE PROPAGATED TO THE ANY HEIRARICHAL  |

	|          | CHILD TAG        | THE ERRORS IN CHILD TAG MUST BE HANDLED LOCALLY , SHOULD NOT BE PROPAGATED TO THE ANY HEIRARICHAL  |

	|          | CONTENT          | SINCE ANY CONTENT INSIDE THE ROW TAG WILL BE AUTO-WRAPPED WITH CELL TAG, SO ERROR HANDLING WILL BE |
	|          |		      | HANDLED ACCORDING TO THE ERROR MECHANIMS OF CELL TAG                                               |

	|          | CONTENT          | SINCE THE ONLY SOURCE OF THE ERROR IN CONTENT IS THE PLUGS , THEN ERROR CAN BE HANDLE  THROUGH     |

	+----------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	AS PER ABOVE TABLE THE  PLUGS ARE REQUIRED FALLBACK MECHANISM AS OTHER ERRORS WILL EITHER PROPAGATED OR IGNORE/WARN 	

	
	

ERROR FALLBACK MECHANISM :

	1. BY DEFINING  ATTRIBUTTE ON_ERROR@ERROR_TYPE 
		HANDLES ALL ERROR OF SPECIFIC TYPE IF ERROR_TYPE IS NOT DEFINED THEN IS PPLIED TO ALL ERROR 
	
		VALUES OF THE ATTRIBUTE CAN BE LIKE :

			PROPAGATE@MESSAGE : PROPAGATES THE ERROR 
			IGNORE@DEFAULT_VALUE : IGNORES THE ERROR AND IN PLACE OF THE PLUG PLACES THE DEFAULT_VALUE 
			WARN@DEFAULT_VALUE : IGNORES THE ERROR AND IN PLACE OF THE PLUG PLACES THE DEFAULT_VALUE 		
			RETRY@LIMIT : RETRIES TO EVALUATION OF THE PLUGS BEFORE  EXECUTING THE SCOPE PLUGS AGAIN 
					RETRY STANDARD OPTION MUST BE CLUBBED WITH OTHER 

		IN THIS ATTRIBUTE THE  ERROR FALLBACK IS GENERAL I.E HANDLING IS APPLIED TO ALL PLUGS WITHIN THE SCOPE 
	
	SUGGEST WAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE ERROR FALLBACK MECHANISM FOR SPECIFIC PLUGS / INSTEAD OF GENERAL
